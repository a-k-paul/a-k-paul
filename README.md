# Hi, I’m Adena

I’m a biomedical engineering student passionate about using technology to solve real-world healthcare problems. My interests lie at the intersection of computational modeling, biomechanics, and immune system dynamics. I love building tools and simulations that help us understand biological systems — and I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
