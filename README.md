# Hi, Iâ€™m Adena

Iâ€™m a biomedical engineering student passionate about using technology to solve real-world healthcare problems. My interests lie at the intersection of computational modeling, biomechanics, and immune system dynamics. I love building tools and simulations that help us understand biological systems â€” and I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
